		<div class="primary">

			<p>While working together in a small crew of up to five, students will take turns as writer, director, actor, lighting or audio specialist, and editor. They&rsquo;ll also learn how to incorporate photographs, music, sound effects and titles into their short documentary films.</p>

			<p>Creativity is highly encouraged, so new and interesting script ideas created by the students are welcomed.</p>

			<p>At the end of each workshop, completed films are screened by family, friends and guests. Also, each filmmaker takes home a professionally-produced DVD with her or his work along with an internet-ready clip.</p>

			<p>9ZERO7 Films is offering these classes to children and teens in the Greater Washington, DC Area because of our passion for documentary film production, and our desire to encourage our youth to develop their own voice and creativity.</p>
